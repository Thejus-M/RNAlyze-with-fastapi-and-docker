# RNAlyse: A   Machine Learning Based Approach for RNA Sequence Analysis and Classification üß¨ üß™ üíª

This repository contains the code and data for a project aimed at finding whether a given DNA sequence is coding RNA or non-coding RNA using machine learning models. The project uses various features of the DNA sequence to train the models. 



# Features üîç
-  ORF length
	* T0
	* T1
	* T2
	* T3
-  ORF Ratio
-  Transcript Length
-  GC Content
-  Aromaticity
-  Isoelectric Point
-  Relative Codon Bias
-  Stop Codon Frequency
-  Molecular Weight
-  CpG Islands
-  Instability Index
-  Fickett Score
-  Gravy Score

# Dataset üìä

The data set used in this study consisted of both coding and long non-coding RNA sequences from the Homo Sapiens species and the Mus Musculus species. The coding RNA and  noncoding RNA sequences are downloaded from GENCODE  and NONCODE  databases.. The sequences are in FASTA format and have been pre-processed to extract various features such as ORF length, protein coding potential, etc. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, with 80% of the data used for training and the remaining 20% used for testing.

# Models ü§ñ

The following machine learning models have been implemented for this project:

-    Logistic Regression
-    Support Vector Machine (SVM)
-    Naive Bayes
-    Random Forest

These models have been trained using the features extracted from the dataset and are used to predict whether a given DNA sequence is coding RNA or non-coding RNA.
